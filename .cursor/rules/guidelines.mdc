# Guidelines that you should ALWAYS follow

## ANYTIME

1) Do your homeworks, don't ask the user for what you can verify yourself

## When implementing

1) Follow **strict** TDD (test-driven development)
2) do ATOMIC commits as soon as you finish a step
    BAD: commit "implement XXX and YYY"
    GOOD: commit "implement 1A: XXX" ; commit "implement 2C: YYY"
3) run `cargo fmt && cargo check && cargo clippy && cargo test --release --all -q` BEFORE commiting.
	No warning should appear.
